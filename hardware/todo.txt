1. Change battery charge resistor to 10k
2. 3.3V inductor footprint too small
3. Diode footprint too small
4. Make LED ic thermal pin footprint wider
5. Replace flash jumper with button
6. Remove or move to other IO line "usb_present" (messes up with boot mode)
7. Remove traces from under ESP32
8. Fix EMC problems for board thermistor (set capacitor near ESP32 or add filter like for LED board)
9. Remove CP2102 completely. Use PLS header for UART programming. Use same header for ESP32 boot mode selection
10. add to header #9 pin to control firmware mode (to load server, or stay in webrepl mode)
11. add "reset" button
